1. I’d like to create an application that allows people to make pet groomer appointments for their dog or cat. The application is for anyone with a dog or cat that would like the convenience of making an appointment on their mobile device. The user would be able to find a groomer within a certain mile radius from the user’s current location or zip code. The application would ask the user for information about their pet such as the pet’s name and if the pet is a cat or a dog. If it’s a dog, the app will ask what size dog is based on weight. The larger the dog, the more expensive the service would be.


2. Organization and Time Management: I’ll need to make sure I finish this practice in a timely manner, so I’m going to block out some time in my day to be able to concentrate. I’m definitely going to jot down my overall idea for this application and make note of my top priorities and then build from there. 

Values, Data Types, and Operations: I’ll be using readline-sync to ask for input from the user about their pet. I’ll be using some primitive data types in my code for the application. I’ll need to use numbers to represent the weight of the dog to figure out the price. Booleans will be used in conditional statements for example: if the user wants to make an appointment for a cat, then a certain code will run, but if the user says they have a dog, then a different set of code will run. 

The Growth Mindset: I’m expecting to run into some roadblocks while writing the code. I will probably create some errors but will try my hardest to correct them and learn from them.

Stringing Characters Together: I’ll be using (\n) newline when I display a list of instructions for the user’s visit to the groomer. I’ll also be using concatenation frequently while repeatedly incorporating the pet’s name (“ “ + petName + “ “) into prompts for users to give it a personal feel.

Control Structures and Logic: To figure out how much the groomer visit will cost will depend on the weight of the pet, so I”ll be using boolean expressions and conditional statements ex: 
if ((41 <= weight) && (weight <= 80)) If the weight falls into this category, the price will be a certain amount. If the weight is less or more than this condition, the price will be different. 

Working with Loops: For arrays that I will build, I will use loops to store the information from those arrays.

Building Arrays: I would use a mixed type array for storing the clients’ information that would include client’s name, pet’s name, cat or dog, pet’s weight, a boolean showing if the client is a returning customer. 

Using Arrays: The array that stores the clients’ info can be added to if a client would like to bring in another pet that is not yet in the groomer’s records, or I could remove a pet from the records if that pet unfortunately passed away.
